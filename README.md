# üì¨ Landing Page with MongoDB & CI/CD

A lightweight, scalable web application designed as a landing page for collecting user contact data. It features a complete CI/CD pipeline for fully automated deployments.

## üîç Overview

This project provides a functional landing page with a contact form that captures user emails. The data is securely stored in a cloud-hosted **MongoDB Atlas** database. The application sends an automated confirmation email to the user and supports a full DevOps workflow, including containerization with **Docker** and automated deployment via **GitHub Actions** and webhooks.

It is an ideal template for small businesses, marketing campaigns, or as a hands-on project for DevOps practices.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ Responsive HTML5/CSS3 landing page with an integrated contact form.
- ‚úÖ Secure email collection with server-side validation and duplicate prevention.
- ‚úÖ Cloud-hosted database integration with **MongoDB Atlas**.
- ‚úÖ Automated email confirmation workflow using **Nodemailer** and Gmail SMTP.
- ‚úÖ Secure management of secrets and environment variables.
- ‚úÖ Fully containerized with **Docker** for consistent, portable deployments.
- ‚úÖ **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipeline with GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images.
- ‚úÖ **Continuous Deployment (CD)** enabled by webhook-triggered updates on the production server.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3 (static page) |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose |
| **Email** | Nodemailer (with Gmail SMTP) |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Docker Hub, GitHub Actions, Webhooks |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed locally.
- A running MongoDB instance (either local or a free cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)).
- A Gmail account with an "App Password" enabled for Nodemailer.

### Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/VipInformatique/landing-mongo-app.git](https://github.com/VipInformatique/landing-mongo-app.git)
    cd landing-mongo-app
    ```

2.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your credentials. This file is listed in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.
    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection URI
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@your-cluster.mongodb.net/your-db
    
    # Gmail Credentials for Nodemailer
    EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
    EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the application locally:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üê≥ Docker Support

You can also run this application as a Docker container.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t vipinformatique/landing-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    Remember to pass your environment variables to the container.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
      --name landing-app \
      --env-file ./.env \
      vipinformatique/landing-app
    ```

## üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

-   The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/main.yml` is triggered on every push to a tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
-   It automatically builds a new Docker image.
-   The new image is pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vipinformatique/landing-app) with both a version tag and the `latest` tag.

### Continuous Deployment (CD) - Server-Side

-   The CI pipeline notifies a webhook listener (e.g., `adnanh/webhook`) on the production server after a successful image push.
-   The webhook listener executes a deployment script (`update.sh`) on the server.
-   The `update.sh` script automatically pulls the latest Docker image and restarts the application container, ensuring a seamless update.
